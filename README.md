# weather-dashboard

# description

This is a weather dashboard that allows the user to input any major city in the world and they will be presented with the current weather conditions. which include a weather icon on the top the show the conditions outside, along with the city name and date, and it also displays the current temperature, wind speed, humidity and uv index. and below that is the 5 day outlook that displays the date of the day along with a condition icon, temperature, wind speed, and humidty information. 

It was also required to have a history section that displays the past cities the user has searched for. unfortanetely i couldnt get that to work. still trying to figure out how to getItems from local storage. i was able to sucessful set the input city into the local storage but couldnt save the input onto the doc.

# Usage

Used like a basic weather dashboard, type in the desired city you want to view and you will be presented with the current conditions along with a 5 day outlook.
